# About dWeb Blog

dWeb Blog is about building a better internet and using what we have more safely:

- helping people build the decentralised Web
- how to build a fast stylish [cough] decentralised website
- learning decentralising technology
- regaining control of your data and your privacy
- helping transition to _Safe Network_ and _Solid on Safe_

In particular, the following technology is of interest here:

- **Safe Network:** a secure, decentralised network for privacy, security and freedom.
- **Solid:** a decentralisation project Tim Berners-Lee who invented the web.

More on those here: [Why Solid on Safe?](/blog/post/004-why-solid-on-safe/)

## The Author
I'm just an old guy with a keyboard who's watched the birth and capture of the internet, and is not happy about it.

This is blog is both a resource and a demonstration of how decentralising internet and web services can help us reclaim and remake the internet as a universally accessible resource open to all for sharing, learning and building while remaining human!

So if you want to build, a blog for example, please grab the [dWeb Blog code](https://github.com/happybeing/dweb-blog) from github and make it your own, and if you want to help me with any of the aims above get in touch on github ([@happybeing](https://github.com/happybeing)), Safe Network forum ([@happybeing](https://safenetforum.org/u/happybeing)) or Mastodon ([@happyborg](https://fosstodon.org/@happyborg)).
